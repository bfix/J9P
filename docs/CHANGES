    J9P - Pure Java implementation for Styx/9P protocol servers
#######################################################################


Version 1.0 --> 1.1 (2009/04/22)

    * Completely reworked authentication in J9P to support other
      authentication schemes than just Inferno. Work for a generic
      'p9any' support is started and the protocols 'p2sk1' and
      'p9sk2' are supported under Plan9.
      
    * Changed source license from 'GPLv3' to 'LGPLv3' to allow the
      use of the framework in non-GPL environments.
      
    * Include AspectJ debugging aspects (used internally for debugging,
      development-only aspects). Are not needed and automatically
      removed from distributed libraries if compiled with Ant. Use
      Eclipse or any other IDE with AspectJ support to use the
      aspects for your own work on the framework.
